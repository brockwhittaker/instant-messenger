# instant-messenger
This is a very basic instant messenger/public comment board that uses only two pages and a text file.

The instant messenger is composed of three parts:

1. The main page that in this project includes css and javascript. It also utilizes the jQuery library for AJAX and interactivity.
2. The PHP <- used to process and input data into the text-file.
3. The text file where everything is saved. No SQL, so it's not secure, but it's simple.
